# Endless-Runner
This is an Endless Runner made entirely with Visual Script on Unity, project still in development.  
This a game of an online course I'm creating for arkde.com to teach people the basics of game development in unity without code.  
Which is why is not only about development with Visual Script but also some basics regarding lighting, VFX graph, shader graph, postprocessing and more.
